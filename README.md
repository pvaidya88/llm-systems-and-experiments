# Paper Implementations and Applied Experiments

Small, reproducible implementations of research ideas plus a few applied ML systems. Not every folder is a paper reimplementation.

## Start here (recruiter friendly)
- `rlm-demo` — Recursive Language Model demo using a Python REPL loop with root vs sub model experiments
- `docqa_vectorless_gpt52` — Vectorless document QA with table extraction, sparse retrieval, and citations
- `learning-to-discover-at-test-time_ttt-discover_ramsey-r55` — TTT-Discover style search for a Ramsey R(5,5) graph

## What this repo demonstrates
- LLM systems work with controlled prompting, routing, and evaluation
- Retrieval and reasoning without a vector database when constraints require it
- Search and verification loops for hard combinatorial problems

## Projects
- `rlm-demo` - Recursive Language Model (RLM) demo with a Python REPL loop and root/sub model experiments
- `docqa_vectorless_gpt52` - Vectorless document QA using OpenAI Responses API only
- `learning-to-discover-at-test-time_ttt-discover_ramsey-r55` - TTT-Discover-style search for a Ramsey R(5,5) graph

## Repo layout
- Each top-level folder is a standalone project with its own README
- Some projects are paper inspired, some are applied systems
