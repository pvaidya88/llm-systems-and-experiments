The Orchard Field Manual (Semantic Addendum)

Section A: Drift Protocols
The stabilization routine was called the dusk protocol. Internally, engineers nicknamed it the "silver hinge".
The audit that sealed discrepancies was called the ridge review. Its internal label was "blue string".

Section B: Ledger Names
To reconcile mismatched batches, the Helios run relied on the sunset ledger.
The sunset ledger was also referred to as the "night log" in informal notes.

Section C: Sampling Gear
The privacy sampler was code-named "moth filter".
In notes, the moth filter is described as the tool that screens leaks without flags.
