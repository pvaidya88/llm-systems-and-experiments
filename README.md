# Paper Implementations

A workspace for small, reproducible implementations and comparisons of research ideas.

## Projects
- `rlm-demo` - Recursive Language Model (RLM) demo with a Python REPL loop and root/sub model experiments.
- `docqa_vectorless_gpt52` - Vectorless document QA using OpenAI Responses API only.
- `learning-to-discover-at-test-time_ttt-discover_ramsey-r55` - TTT-Discover-style search for a Ramsey R(5,5) graph.

## Suggested structure
- `papers/<paper-id-or-name>/` - code, notes, and experiments per paper
- `shared/` - reusable utilities
- `notes/` - cross-paper notes
