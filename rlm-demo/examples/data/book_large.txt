Chapter 1: Seeds and Soil
The Orchard Engine was proposed in 2022 by Lina Park as a lightweight reasoning loop.
It has three phases: seed, prune, and graft. The seed phase builds a working set of facts.
The prune phase removes contradictions. The graft phase merges newly discovered facts.
The early prototype used handwritten "catalog cards" instead of a vector database.

Chapter 2: Selection without Vectors
This chapter describes the "lens" method: keyword grep, BM25 over chunks, and heading scans.
In the Greenleaf benchmark (120 questions across 6 chapters), the best vectorless setup
reached 78% accuracy using BM25 plus expand-around-anchor. Grep alone reached 52%.
Heading scans were most helpful for chapter titles and named entities.

Chapter 3: Recursive Inquiry
Three failure modes were observed: anchor drift, premature finalization, and silent truncation.
The most common failure was silent truncation (43%), followed by anchor drift (31%).
Depth-2 recursion improved accuracy on cross-chapter questions by 9 points.

Chapter 4: Orchard Trials
The Redwood trial adopted a prune-first schedule to stabilize selection.
In the Redwood trial report, anchor drift fell to 18% once the prune-first schedule was enforced.

Appendix A: Paraphrase Notes
"Eliminates contradictions" is used interchangeably with "prune phase removes contradictions."
"Share" refers to the reported percentage in the benchmark results.

Appendix B: Retrieval Paraphrases
"Wobble" refers to anchor drift in the trial reports.
"Paper index" is a nickname for the catalog cards used in Chapter 1.
"Leaf score" refers to the accuracy reported in the Greenleaf benchmark.


Chapter 5: Scaling Notes
The Orchard Engine scaled to 500 pages by chunking at 1200 characters with 160 overlap.
A later run reported that premature finalization dropped to 12% when the prune phase was repeated.

Chapter 6: Field Logs
In field logs, the team used the term "garden pass" for a full selection loop.
Greenleaf chapter summaries were stored as heading scans for fast lookup.

Chapter 7: Evaluation Appendix
The Bluefin study reported 64% accuracy using embeddings with a single pass.
The evaluation checklist emphasized quoting the exact sentence that supported each answer.

Appendix C: Additional Notes
"Garden pass" refers to the same loop described in Chapter 3.
"Heading scans" are the heading_index calls from the selection layer.
"Prune-first" means the prune phase happens before graft in that run.

Appendix D: Recovery Notes
The emergency rollback was internally dubbed the "amber latch" after the lock hardware used in testing.
